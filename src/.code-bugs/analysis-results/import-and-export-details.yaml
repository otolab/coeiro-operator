        # Analysis Report


        This report details the analysis of the provided source code based on
        the procedures outlined in the [Analysis Procedure
        Guide](analysis-procedure-guide).


        ## 1. Dependency details


        The file's dependencies on external modules are as follows. This list
        includes modules imported via `import` statements.


        ```yaml

        "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js":
          - McpServer
        "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js":
          - StdioServerTransport
        "child_process":
          - spawn
          - ChildProcess
        "zod":
          - z
        "./say/index.js":
          - SayCoeiroink
          - loadConfig
        "./operator/index.js":
          - OperatorManager
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        The analysis is based on the `import` statements found at the beginning
        of the file (part 1 of 18).


        ```javascript

        import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";

        import { StdioServerTransport } from
        "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

        import { spawn, ChildProcess } from "child_process";

        import { z } from "zod";

        import { SayCoeiroink, loadConfig } from "./say/index.js";

        import { OperatorManager } from "./operator/index.js";

        ```


        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        No variable-based dynamic imports (e.g., `require(variable)` or
        `import(variable)`) were found in the code.


        **Reasoning:**

        The code uses `spawn` to execute an external command
        (`operator-manager`), but this is process execution, not module
        importing. All `import` statements are static.


        ```javascript

        // Example of external process execution, not a dynamic import

        const result = await spawnAsync("operator-manager", ["release"]);

        ```


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        No dependencies on non-standard global variables or constants were
        identified.


        **Reasoning:**

        The code utilizes standard global objects provided by the Node.js
        environment, such as `console`, `process`, `Error`, and `Promise`. No
        custom or non-standard global variables (like a `CONFIG` object) are
        accessed.


        ```javascript

        // Standard global usage

        console.error("Initializing COEIRO Operator services...");

        // ...

        child.on("error", (err) => {
          reject(new Error(`Failed to execute command: ${err.message}`));
        });

        // ...

        process.exit(1);

        ```


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No evidence of prototype pollution was detected during this best-effort
        analysis.


        **Reasoning:**

        The methods used on native objects (e.g., `Object.entries`,
        `Array.prototype.filter`, `Array.prototype.map`) are all standard and do
        not suggest any modification of native prototypes.


        ## 5. Module interface


        This file does not export any interfaces. It is designed as an
        executable script, indicated by the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node` at the
        beginning.


        **Reasoning:**

        There are no `export` statements in the entire file. The script's
        purpose is to be executed directly to start a server, not to be imported
        as a module into other parts of an application. The `main` function at
        the end of the file serves as the entry point for execution.


        ```javascript

        #!/usr/bin/env node

        // ... (no export statements) ...


        async function main(): Promise<void> {
          const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
          await server.connect(transport);
          console.error("Say COEIROINK MCP Server started");
        }


        main().catch((error) => {
          console.error("Server error:", error);
          process.exit(1);
        });

        ```
