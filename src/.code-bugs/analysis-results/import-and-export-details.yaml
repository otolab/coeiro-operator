        # Analysis Report


        This report details the analysis of the provided source code.


        ## 1. Dependency details


        Based on the `import` statements at the beginning of the file, the
        dependencies are as follows:


        ```yaml

        @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js:
          - McpServer
        @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js:
          - StdioServerTransport
        child_process:
          - spawn
          - ChildProcess
        zod:
          - z
        ./say/index.js:
          - SayCoeiroink
          - loadConfig
        ./operator/index.js:
          - OperatorManager
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        The analysis is based on the static `import` statements found at the top
        of the source file. Each module and the specific named imports from it
        have been listed.


        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        No dynamic imports, where the module path is determined by a variable at
        runtime, were found in the code.


        **Reasoning:**

        The code was scanned for dynamic `import()` expressions and `require()`
        calls with variable arguments. While the `spawnAsync` function executes
        an external command (`operator-manager`), this is considered process
        execution, not a dynamic module import within the Node.js environment.


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        No non-standard global variables or constants were found to be used.


        **Reasoning:**

        The code utilizes standard Node.js global objects such as `process`
        (e.g., `process.env`, `process.exit`) and `console`. These are part of
        the standard execution environment and are therefore excluded from the
        report. No other undefined variables that would resolve to global scope
        were identified.


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No potential prototype pollution was detected in the analyzed code.


        **Reasoning:**

        The code was reviewed for any modifications to the prototypes of
        built-in JavaScript objects (e.g., `Object.prototype`,
        `Array.prototype`). No such modifications were found.


        ## 5. Module interface


        This file is an executable script and does not export any functions,
        classes, or variables. Therefore, it has no external module interface.


        **Reasoning:**

        The source code does not contain any `export` statements (`export
        default`, `export const`, `module.exports`, etc.). The file is
        structured as a self-contained application initiated by the `main`
        function, indicating it's intended to be run directly, not imported as a
        module.
