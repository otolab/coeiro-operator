        # Analysis Report


        This report details the analysis of the provided source code, which is a
        Node.js executable script designed to run as a server for the Model
        Context Protocol (MCP). The analysis follows the procedures outlined in
        the [Analysis Procedure Guide](analysis-procedure-guide).


        ## 1. Dependency details


        The script has the following dependencies on external and internal
        modules.


        *   **Analysis Result:**

            ```yaml
            @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js:
              - McpServer
            @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js:
              - StdioServerTransport
            child_process:
              - spawn
              - ChildProcess
            zod:
              - z
            ./say/index.js:
              - SayCoeiroink
              - loadConfig
            ./operator/index.js:
              - OperatorManager
            ```

        *   **Reasoning:**
            The dependencies are identified from the `import` statements at the beginning of the file (`partOf: 1 of 21`). These statements explicitly declare which modules and specific components are being used by the script.

        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        The script does not contain any variable-based dynamic imports
        (`require(\`...\`)` or `import()`).


        *   **Analysis Result:**
            No dynamic imports determined at run-time were found.

        *   **Reasoning:**
            A full scan of the code was performed. While the script uses `spawn` from `child_process` to execute external commands like `operator-manager` (e.g., in `partOf: 15 of 21`), this is process execution, not module importing. There are no instances of module paths being constructed dynamically from variables.

        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        The script does not rely on any non-standard global variables or
        constants.


        *   **Analysis Result:**
            No dependencies on non-standard global variables were found.

        *   **Reasoning:**
            The code utilizes standard Node.js globals such as `console`, `process`, `Promise`, and `Error`. No undefined variables that would resolve to globals were identified. All dependencies are explicitly imported.

        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No clear instances of Prototype Pollution were detected.


        *   **Analysis Result:**
            No potential Prototype Pollution was detected in this best-effort analysis.

        *   **Reasoning:**
            The code was reviewed for patterns that might lead to prototype pollution, such as modifying `Object.prototype` or unsafe object property assignments from external inputs. While there are dynamic property accesses, such as in `extractStyleInfo` (`partOf: 9 of 21`), they do not appear to be exploitable for prototype pollution.

        ## 5. Module interface


        This file is an executable script and does not export any interfaces.


        *   **Analysis Result:**
            This module does not export any functions, variables, or classes.

        *   **Reasoning:**
            The file starts with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) indicating it's an executable script. A review of the entire codebase confirms the absence of any `export` statements. The script's purpose is to be executed directly to start the server, not to be imported as a module into other parts of an application. The `main` function (`partOf: 20 of 21`) serves as the entry point for execution.
