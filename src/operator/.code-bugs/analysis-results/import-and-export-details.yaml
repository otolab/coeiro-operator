        # Analysis Report for `src/operator/character-defaults.ts`


        This document provides an analysis of the source code file
        `src/operator/character-defaults.ts` based on the provided analysis
        procedure guide.


        ## 1. Dependency details


        No external or internal modules are imported in this file. The code
        consists solely of type definitions and constant exports, with no
        dependencies on other modules.


        **Conclusion:** There are no dependencies.


        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        The code was scanned for dynamic imports where the module path is
        determined by a variable at runtime (e.g.,
        `require(\`./modules/\${moduleName}\`)`).


        **Conclusion:** No such dynamic imports were found in this file.


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        The code was analyzed for the use of non-standard global variables or
        constants. The file only defines and exports its own constants and does
        not reference any external or global variables.


        **Conclusion:** No dependencies on global variables or constants were
        found.


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        The code was reviewed for potential prototype pollution. The file
        primarily consists of static object definitions and does not perform any
        operations that modify the prototypes of native objects.


        **Conclusion:** No evidence of prototype pollution was found.


        ## 5. Module interface


        This module exports two constants that define character configurations
        and a mapping from speaker names to IDs.


        **Analysis:**

        The following interfaces are exported from this module:


        -   `export const BUILTIN_CHARACTER_CONFIGS: Record<string,
        CharacterConfig>`: A constant object containing default configurations
        for built-in characters. The `CharacterConfig` interface, while not
        explicitly exported, defines the structure of each configuration object.

        -   `export const SPEAKER_NAME_TO_ID_MAP: Record<string, string>`: A
        constant object that maps character names (in Japanese) to their
        corresponding internal IDs.


        **Details:**


        ```

        details:
          - value: const BUILTIN_CHARACTER_CONFIGS: Record<string, CharacterConfig>
          - value: const SPEAKER_NAME_TO_ID_MAP: Record<string, string>
        ```

        # Analysis Report: src/operator/cli.ts


        This document provides an analysis of the `src/operator/cli.ts` file
        based on the provided analysis procedures. The file serves as the
        command-line interface for operator management.


        Since all chunks for the file were provided in this iteration, this
        report covers the entire file.


        ---


        ## 1. Dependency details


        The analysis of dependencies reveals the following:


        ```yaml

        ./index.js:
          - *
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        - The file imports `OperatorManager` from `./index.js` using a default
        import (`import OperatorManager from './index.js';`). As per the
        analysis guide, a default import is treated as importing the entirety of
        the module's main exports, represented by `*`.

        - The code also utilizes standard Node.js global objects like `process`
        and `console`, which are considered part of the execution environment
        and are not listed as module dependencies.


        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        There are no dynamically determined imports in this file.


        **Reasoning:**

        - A review of the code confirms that all `import` statements use static
        string literals for module paths. There are no instances of `require()`
        or `import()` with variable arguments that would resolve at runtime.


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        No non-standard global variables or constants were identified.


        **Reasoning:**

        - The code relies on standard built-in globals provided by the Node.js
        environment, such as `process` (for `process.argv` and `process.exit`)
        and `console` (for logging). No custom or undeclared global variables
        are accessed.


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No potential instances of prototype pollution were detected.


        **Reasoning:**

        - The analysis, performed on a best-effort basis, did not find any code
        that modifies the prototypes of native JavaScript objects or calls
        non-standard methods on them.


        ## 5. Module interface


        The module exposes the `OperatorManagerCLI` class as its default export.


        ```

        details:
          - value: default OperatorManagerCLI
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        - The file defines the `OperatorManagerCLI` class, which encapsulates
        all the logic for the CLI commands such as `assign`, `release`, and
        `status`.

        - The final statement, `export default OperatorManagerCLI;`, makes this
        class the sole public interface of the module.

        - The file is also designed as an executable script, which instantiates
        and runs this class when invoked directly, as seen in the `if
        (import.meta.url === \`file://\${process.argv[1]}\`)` block.

        class.

        # Analysis Report for src/operator/config-manager.test.ts


        This document provides an analysis of the test file
        `src/operator/config-manager.test.ts` based on the [Analysis Procedure
        Guide](analysis-procedure-guide).


        ## 1. Dependency details


        The file has the following dependencies:


        ```yaml

        ./config-manager.js:
          - ConfigManager
        fs/promises:
          - readFile
          - writeFile
          - access
          - mkdir
        path:
          - join
        os:
          - tmpdir
        fs:
          - "*"
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        - Static imports for `config-manager.js`, `fs/promises`, `path`, and
        `os` are declared at the top of the file.
          ```typescript
          // partOf: 1 of 11
          import { ConfigManager } from './config-manager.js';
          import { readFile, writeFile, access, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
          import { join } from 'path';
          import { tmpdir } from 'os';
          ```
        - A dynamic import for the `fs` module is used within the `afterEach`
        block, which imports the entire module.
          ```typescript
          // partOf: 3 of 11
          afterEach(async () => {
              // 一時ディレクトリをクリーンアップ
              const fs = await import('fs');
              await fs.promises.rm(tempDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
          });
          ```

        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        There are no dynamic imports where the module path is determined by a
        variable at runtime.


        **Reasoning:**

        The file contains a dynamic import `await import('fs')`, but its path is
        a static string literal (`'fs'`), not a variable. Therefore, it does not
        fit the criteria for this section.


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        The code depends on the following non-standard global
        variables/constants:


        - `fetch`


        **Reasoning:**

        The test code explicitly mocks the `fetch` function by assigning it to
        `global.fetch`. This demonstrates a dependency on a globally available
        `fetch` function, which is manipulated for testing purposes.


        ```typescript

        // partOf: 2 of 11

        // fetchのモック

        global.fetch = jest.fn();


        // partOf: 8 of 11

        (global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({
            ok: true,
            json: async () => mockResponse
        });

        ```

        *Note: Standard testing globals provided by the Jest framework (e.g.,
        `describe`, `test`, `expect`, `jest`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`) are
        considered part of the standard execution environment for this test file
        and are not listed.*


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No potential prototype pollution was detected in this file.


        **Reasoning:**

        A review of the code did not reveal any modifications to the prototypes
        of native JavaScript objects (e.g., `Object.prototype`).


        ## 5. Module interface


        This file is a test module and does not export any interfaces.


        **Reasoning:**

        There are no `export` statements in the file. This indicates that it is
        intended for testing purposes only and does not provide any
        functionality to other modules.

        # Analysis Report for `src/operator/config-manager.ts`


        ## File Overview


        This file, `src/operator/config-manager.ts`, defines the `ConfigManager`
        class, which is responsible for managing application configurations. Its
        core responsibilities include:

        -   Dynamically fetching available voice fonts from a COEIROINK server.

        -   Merging built-in character configurations, dynamically fetched voice
        information, and user-defined settings from JSON files.

        -   Managing configuration caching to optimize performance.

        -   Providing utility methods for safe JSON file I/O and deep merging of
        objects.


        The analysis is based on the provided source code and the related test
        file, `[Related test:
        config-manager.test.ts](related-file-config-manager.test.ts)`.


        ---


        ## 1. Dependency details


        The module has the following dependencies on other modules:


        ```yaml

        fs/promises:
          - readFile
          - writeFile
          - mkdir
          - access
        fs:
          - constants
          - promises
        path:
          - join
        ./character-defaults.js:
          - BUILTIN_CHARACTER_CONFIGS
          - SPEAKER_NAME_TO_ID_MAP
        ```


        ### Analysis Rationale


        -   **Static Imports**: The dependencies on `fs/promises`, `fs`, `path`,
        and `./character-defaults.js` are explicitly declared using `import`
        statements at the top of the file.

        -   **Dynamic Import**: The `writeJsonFile` method uses `await
        import('fs')` to dynamically import the `fs` module for file renaming
        operations. This is considered a dependency on the `promises` property
        of the `fs` module.


        ---


        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        There are no dynamic imports where the module path is determined by a
        variable.


        ### Analysis Rationale


        The code contains a dynamic import `await import('fs')`, but the path
        `'fs'` is a static string literal. No instances of `require(variable)`
        or `import(variable)` were found, which would pose a risk of hiding
        dependencies from static analysis.


        ---


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        The module depends on the following non-standard global
        variable/function:


        -   `fetch`


        ### Analysis Rationale


        -   The `fetchAvailableVoices` method uses the `fetch` function to make
        HTTP requests to the COEIROINK server.

        -   While `fetch` is standard in modern Node.js (v18+) and browsers,
        it's treated as a global dependency provided by the execution
        environment.

        -   The related test file `[Related test:
        config-manager.test.ts](related-file-config-manager.test.ts)` confirms
        this dependency by explicitly mocking `global.fetch`.


        ---


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No potential prototype pollution was detected in this file.


        ### Analysis Rationale


        The `deepMerge` utility function recursively merges objects. However, it
        operates on copies (`const result = { ...target };`) and does not modify
        the prototypes of standard JavaScript objects like `Object.prototype`.
        The implementation appears safe from prototype pollution.


        ---


        ## 5. Module interface


        The module exports the following interfaces, class, and a default
        export.


        ```

        details:
          - value: export interface CharacterStyle { name: string; style_id: number; personality: string; speaking_style: string; disabled?: boolean; }
          - value: export interface CharacterConfig { name: string; personality: string; speaking_style: string; greeting: string; farewell: string; default_style: string; style_selection: string; voice_id: string | null; available_styles: Record<string, CharacterStyle>; disabled?: boolean; }
          - value: export class ConfigManager
          - value: export default ConfigManager
        ```


        ### Analysis Rationale


        The exported members were identified from the `export` and `export
        default` keywords in the source code.

        -   **Interfaces**: `CharacterStyle` and `CharacterConfig` are exported
        for type-checking in other modules that interact with the configuration.

        -   **Class**: The main `ConfigManager` class is exported for
        instantiation and use.

        -   **Default Export**: The `ConfigManager` class is also the default
        export of the module, allowing for `import ConfigManager from
        './config-manager.js';`.

        summarized, single-line representation for each export as per the
        guidelines, instead of the full multi-line interface definitions.

        # Analysis Report for src/operator/index.ts


        This report provides a detailed analysis of the source file
        `src/operator/index.ts`. The analysis covers dependencies, dynamic
        imports, global variable usage, potential prototype pollution, and the
        module's public interface.


        The entire file (`partOf: 1 of 27` to `27 of 27`) has been processed.


        ## 1. Dependency details


        The module's dependencies are as follows:


        ```yaml

        fs/promises:
          - readFile
          - writeFile
          - stat
          - mkdir
          - unlink
          - rename
          - access
        fs:
          - constants
          - *
        path:
          - join
        child_process:
          - spawn
          - exec
        ./config-manager.js:
          - *
          - CharacterConfig
          - CharacterStyle
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        - Static `import` statements at the beginning of the file (`partOf: 2 of
        27`) declare dependencies on `fs/promises`, `fs`, `path`,
        `child_process`, and `./config-manager.js`.

        - The default import `ConfigManager` is represented as `*`.

        - The `clearAllOperators` method (`partOf: 22 of 27`) uses dynamic
        `import()` for `fs` and `child_process`. The `fs` import is a namespace
        import (`const fs = await import('fs')`), so it is represented as `*`.
        The `child_process` import uses destructuring (`const { exec } = ...`),
        so only `exec` is listed from this dynamic import.


        ## 2. Dynamic import determined at run-time


        No dynamically determined imports were found in the code.


        **Reasoning:**

        The file contains dynamic `import()` calls (e.g., `await import('fs')`
        in `partOf: 22 of 27`), but the module paths are static strings, not
        variables. Therefore, there are no imports that are resolved only at
        run-time based on variable content.


        ## 3. Global variables / constants


        No non-standard global variables or constants were found.


        **Reasoning:**

        The code uses standard Node.js global objects such as `process` (e.g.,
        `process.env`, `process.cwd()`, `process.ppid`), `console`, `JSON`, and
        `Math`. According to the analysis procedure, these standard
        environment-provided globals are not reported.


        ## 4. Prototype Pollution


        No potential instances of prototype pollution were detected.


        **Reasoning:**

        A best-effort analysis of the code did not reveal any non-standard
        methods being added to or called from the prototypes of native
        JavaScript objects like `Object`, `Array`, or `String`. All method calls
        observed (e.g., `Object.entries`, `Array.prototype.filter`,
        `String.prototype.replace`) are standard to the ECMAScript or Node.js
        environment.


        ## 5. Module interface


        The module exports the `OperatorManager` class, both as a named export
        and as the default export.


        ```

        details:
          - value: export class OperatorManager
          - value: export default OperatorManager
        ```


        **Reasoning:**

        - The `OperatorManager` class is declared with `export class
        OperatorManager` (`partOf: 11 of 27`).

        - The class is also exported as the default export of the module with
        `export default OperatorManager` (`partOf: 27 of 27`). The class and all
        its public methods constitute the primary interface of this module.
